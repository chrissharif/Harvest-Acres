## Code Showcase

This is the code for my Edit Post popup. I was very happy to get the popup working and be able to keep everything neat. I also never have used textarea, so this was also a learning moment for me.

```
{isOpen && <EditPost content={<>
  <form className='message-form' onSubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    handleUpdate(post.id, formData)
    togglePopup()
  }}>
  <textarea
    className='message-form-input'
    placeholder='edit message...'
    cols='30'
    rows='10'
    type='text'
    name='description'
    maxLength='100'
    autoComplete='off'
    value={description}
    onChange={handleChange}
  />
  <button className='message-board-button'>Edit Message</button>
  </form>
</>} handleClose={togglePopup} />}
```

## Code Issues & Resolutions

  - Realized URL was set as Url in api-config
- Wasn't able to type in my forms
  - Had a small syntax error
- Wasn't able to edit posts
  - Forgot to pass in 'id' through handleUpdate function
